## Specify a run that can be considered a baseline for iRT retention times so that the rt shift can be protocolled.
## Use "pre_run" to use the run prior to (in the skyline file) the run that is reported on.

## The spectral library folders (single or separated by "," no space). Goes up one level before looking for the folder (../ prepend).
## Requires skyline chromatogram_raw_lib.csv (!Skyline Templates/chromatogram_raw_lib.skyr) export. Should be the same data that the skyline spectral library is made from
