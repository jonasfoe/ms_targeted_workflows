# This file names all peptides that are used as RT reference points in order of elution
# To make effective use of orbitrap dynamic RT feature, the PRTC peptides should be present
# Use seq_semi_mod_sky notation (Skyline: Peptide Modified Sequence Monoisotopic Masses) in case there are any modifications
# This file anchors all the irt data in the optimisations folder. So if changes are made here, it may invalidate all that data.
